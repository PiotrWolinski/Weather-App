# Weather-App

This Flask web-app shows usage of [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/current) API with simple styling in vanilla CSS and Bootstrap.

## Configuration

This app needs an openweathermap API key which can be generated after signing up [here](https://openweathermap.org/). After generating one it should be placed as the **OPENWEATHER_KEY** variable in the **config.py** file in the main directory.

## Usage

Simply run an **app.py** from the command line.
